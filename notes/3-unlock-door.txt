TODO: Doors can be locked by default on level entrance
TODO: Doors can be unlocked if Player has a key

- set door property as locked by default
- somehow make it so door detects haskey property on Player

jk all i needed to do was change the openDoor animation
now I need to figure otu how to make the animation NOT trigger when I attempt to
    enter the door without a key
