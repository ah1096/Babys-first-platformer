DONE: center game canvas in middle of viewport; make it looks nicer

- center game canvas in middle of viewport
- add a title heading?
- add the controls in a small box below the canvas

maybe add a title screen later to play on page refresh; currently the 
headings spawn in before the game canvas and it looks weird
