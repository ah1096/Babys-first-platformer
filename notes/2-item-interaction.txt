TODO: Player can interact with item on key press

- I want the player to be able to trigger an interaction with the key item upon pressing the e key
- for now, just triggering a "you picked up a key" console log is fine

currently the key logs "colliding" when the player collides with it; 
I want to go where that chunk of code is and change it so that it says "press e" and if the player
presses e, it logs "you picked up a key"
