DONE Player can interact with item on key press
TODO: Item disappears from the level when it is interacted with

- I want the player to be able to trigger an interaction with the key item upon pressing the e key
- for now, just triggering a "you picked up a key" console log is fine

currently the key logs "colliding" when the player collides with it; 
I want to go where that chunk of code is and change it so that it says "press e" and if the player
presses e, it logs "you picked up a key"


added the code below so that if player is colliding AND pressing e, the text displays:

handleInput(keys) {
        
        if (this.checkForCollisionWithPlayer() === true && keys.e.pressed === true) {
            console.log("you picked up a key!")
        } else {
            return
        }
    }

figure out how to make key disappear from level
- create a removeFromLevel function? if key = pickedUp, then remove from level?
- remove sprite? make invisible?
- i could move the key out of reach of the player?

going to try the out-of-reach approach
